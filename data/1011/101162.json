As the two birds start to fight, many others land on the wire and join in. They are interrupted when a very large, gangly, awkward-looking bird sitting on top of the pole honks to them. Soon, the small birds start mocking the large one by puffing up their feathers to resemble its plumage and imitating its honk. They then slide farther out along the wire and chatter suspiciously among themselves, ignoring the large bird's attempts to befriend them until it settles in the middle of all of them out on the wire. However, its weight causes the wire to sag almost to the ground and all the small birds slide down toward it.\r\nAs the large bird keeps trying to make friends, the small ones get annoyed and try to push it off the wire, only for it to lose its balance and flop over to hang upside down by its feet. The two nearest the center start pecking at its toes, egged on by the rest of the crowd. One of the other birds suddenly panics, realizing how low the wire is, and tries to stop the pecking. The others understand and stop too late; when the large bird's last toe slides off, the wire snaps upward and flings all the small birds out of sight. The large one is so close to the ground that it settles down easily, accompanied by a shower of feathers from the small birds.\r\nOne of them falls to the ground, having lost all its feathers, and the large bird laughs and offers it a leaf to cover itself. The others soon tumble down as well and hide behind the large bird as it laughs even harder. A white splatter with the words, \"the end\" on it against a black screen, similar to the mess caused by bird droppings, marks the end of the film.","info":"<li><span>中文名: </span>鸟！鸟！鸟！</li><li><span>话数: </span>1</li><li><span>制片人: </span><a href=\"/person/22013\">John Lasseter</a></li><li><span>动画制作: </span><a href=\"/person/7960\">Pixar Animation Studios</a></li><li><span>别名: </span>献给鸟儿们</li><li><span style=\"visibility:hidden;\">别名: </span>鸟鸟鸟</li><li><span>上映年度: </span>2000年</li><li><span>片长: </span>3 分钟</li><li><span>官方网站: </span>http://www.pixar.com/shorts/ftb/index.html</li><li><span>发售日: </span>2000年6月5日</li>","collection":{"wish":7,"collect":145,"dropped":2},"tags":[{"name":"短片","count":49},{"name":"pixar","count":30},{"name":"2000","count":24},{"name":"欧美","count":19},{"name":"3D","count":13},{"name":"奥斯卡","count":9},{"name":"美国","count":8},{"name":"皮克斯","count":4},{"name":"鸟","count":4},{"name":"美国动画","count":3},{"name":"剧场版","count":3},{"name":"小鸟欺负大鸟反而","count":3},{"name":"Pixar.Animation.Studios","count":2},{"name":"杂","count":2},{"name":"原创","count":2},{"name":"其它","count":1},{"name":"JohnLasseter","count":1},{"name":"Comedy","count":1},{"name":"電影","count":1},{"name":"跟弟弟一起看的","count":1},{"name":"US","count":1},{"name":"短片&OVA","count":1},{"name":"2000年","count":1},{"name":"欢乐","count":1},{"name":"治愈","count":1},{"name":"动画","count":1},{"name":"动物","count":1},{"name":"美國","count":1},{"name":"動畫","count":1},{"name":"动画短片","count":1}],"eps":[{"id":390128,"url":"http://bgm.tv/ep/390128","type":0,"sort":1,"name":"","name_cn":"","duration":"","airdate":"","comment":0,"desc":"","status":"Air"}],"staff":[{"id":22013,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/d6/bd/22013_prsn_O1jC2.jpg","name":"约翰·拉塞特","desc":"制片人"},{"id":7960,"image":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/crt/g/f5/55/7960_prsn_UD3i1.jpg","name":"皮克斯动画工作室","desc":"动画制作"}]}
